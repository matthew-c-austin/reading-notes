Reading journal for Code Fellows

Hello and welcome to my notes. My name is Matt, and I'm excited to become a web developer![^1] If you're here you can probably find my GitHhub portfolio, but just in case you want a reminder:

## Growth Mindset

To me a growth mindset is the philosophy that intelligence is not fixed; it is dynamic and can be improved through effort and commitment. Like Jake the Dog says,

> Dude, sucking at somethinâ€™ is the first step towards being sorta good at somethin'.

### Three Reminders to Stay in a Growth Mindset

- When you don't understand something, think you can't do it, or think it's not easy, just append the word "yet" to the end.
- A belief in improvement helps you overcome obstacles and improve.
- Success relies on persistence and coping with failures in a healthy way.
