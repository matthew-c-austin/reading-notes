# Reflections

This reading is all about transitions, transforms, and animations using CSS. It seems like the syntactic sugar or some other spice you'd add on top of everything foundational in a web app to make user experience more memorable and enjoyable.

## Reading

[CSS Transforms](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/css-transforms/)

1. What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?

    To distort or transform an element on both a 2D or 3D plane.

2. Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.

    You could have a `scale` value on a selectable element so that it gets bigger as you hover over it.

[CSS Transitions and Animations](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/)

1. What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?

    With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

2. How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?

    Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.

1. What are some benefits to using CSS transitions on websites?

    Just a couple of lines of code will give you an awesome transition effect that will excite your users, increase engagement and ultimately, when used well, increase your conversions.

2. How this topic fit in with your long-term goals?

    Long-term I'd like to do backend development, so 10 years from now it'll just be something I've been exposed to and something I can identify when it's being used.

## Things I want to know more about

1. How "fast-fashion" are these different animations/transitions? It feels almost like the trends fade in and out with time, and something that looked cool 10 years ago seems extremely dated.
