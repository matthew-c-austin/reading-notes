[What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)

This was a very interesting read, and I think it highlights how Code Fellows operates. From the first intro presentation in 201 it's clear that there's an environment of open communication and psychological safety. Promoting this type of mindset makes it easier on me as a student because I don't feel the weird jockeying for position and competition that Rozovsky found in her business school working group.

It also resonates with me based off of my work experience. The best groups I've been in are those where people don't feel bottled up, and I've been happiest in those rare groups where I didn't feel like I had to put on much of a mask because I was at work. Those groups also had great performance metrics.

The rarity of that type of group is probably due to how delicate that environment is. It reminds me a bit of running a dungeons and dragons game. At a dnd table, everyone has to buy into a great deal of silliness, and it only takes just one person to ruin it. One person can be too cool for it, or judgmental, or greedy, or not engaged, and it sours the entire ecosystem at the table.

This is similar to a work team. One peremptory manager or one grating personality is all it takes to set everyone back.
