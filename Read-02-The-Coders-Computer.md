# Choosing a Text Editor
## What is a Text Editor?
A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site

Important features to look for in a text editor:
1. Code Completion
2. Syntax highlighting
3. A variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)
4. The ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions, when needed

## Text Editor Options
You can either use software that comes with your O/S, such as "Text Edit" on Mac or "Notepad" on Windows. For Linux computers, each distribution will have its own text editor already installed but which one might depend on the flavor of your particular distribution. These text editors will go by different names. One distro might have “Gedit,” and others might have other titles. Check you list of applications to see which text editor comes with your distribution of Linux.

However, most of these are extremely bare bones when it comes to features, i.e., none of the sought after features listed above. There are several better third party options
