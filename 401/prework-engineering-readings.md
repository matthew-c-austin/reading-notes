# Reflections

Similar to the growth mindset assignment, this reading assignment lays the foundation for the approach to problem solving that is required for success in this course and in an engineering career.

## Discussion Questions

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

    - One thing I bring to this career is a unique background in aerospace engineering as a structural analyst and lead engineer. This provides me with a strong analytical mindset, the ability to work and lead under pressure in a high stakes environment, and mastery of a domain that develops complex, safety critical systems where documentation is king, and even small mistakes have grave consequences.

2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

    - Break down the problem into smaller, manageable components, and tackle them one by one, as described in the Simple Programmer article. This approach helps you understand the problem better and makes it easier to find a solution.
    - Use the "5 Whys" technique from the Mind Tools article to find the root cause of the issue. By repeatedly asking "why" and digging deeper into the problem, you'll identify the underlying cause and be able to address it more effectively.
    - Follow the advice from the freeCodeCamp article on thinking like a programmer by embracing the process of learning through trial and error. When stuck, seek out resources, such as documentation, forums, or colleagues, to find solutions or alternative approaches
