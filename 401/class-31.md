This reading assignment talks about AWS Amplify, a service that let's you interact with the AWS ecosystem without really knowing what to do with it or what services you really need.

## Readings

[What Is AWS Amplify](https://beabetterdev.com/2021/09/22/what-is-aws-amplify/)

1. What are a few alternatives to AWS Amplify? What are the differences? What are the tradeoffs?

    - Google Firebase, like AWS Amplify, provides a comprehensive suite of tools for mobile and web development, including real-time databases, authentication, cloud storage, and hosting. Firebase integrates well with many Google services but may not be as flexible as AWS Amplify when it comes to other third-party services.

    - Microsoft Azure, while a more general cloud services platform, also offers services similar to AWS Amplify, such as Azure App Service for building and hosting web apps, mobile app backends, and RESTful APIs. Azure has excellent integration with other Microsoft products, which might be a benefit for teams already using these tools.

    - Netlify is a cloud computing company offering hosting and serverless backend services for web applications and static websites. It's straightforward and easy to use but may not offer as many features as AWS Amplify.
