## Reflections

This reading assignment talks about Spring Security, along with Spring's architecture on user authentication and authorization. It's important to know how to verify a user and their permissions in the Spring ecosystem.

## Readings

[Spring Security overview](https://spring.io/guides/topicals/spring-security-architecture/)

1. What does it mean to authenticate a user?

    To authenticate a user means to verify their identity through some form of verification process, such as a password, fingerprint or face recognition.

2. What does it mean to authorize a user?

    To authorize a user means to grant them access to certain resources or actions based on their authenticated identity and assigned permissions.

3. What are the three possible outcomes of the AuthenticationManagerâ€™s authenticate() method?

    - Return an Authentication (normally with authenticated=true) if it can verify that the input represents a valid principal.

    - Throw an AuthenticationException if it believes that the input represents an invalid principal.

    - Return null if it cannot decide.
