## Reflections

This reading assignment talks about purely functional programming, which is a paradigm that is sort of at odds with how we've been doing things in Java, which is very OOP-based.

## Readings

[Purely functional programming, from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional_programming)

1. Can you change the state of a data structure using functional programming?

    In functional programming, the state of a data structure is typically not changed directly. Instead, functional programming favors immutable data structures and pure functions that take inputs and produce outputs without modifying any global state or having side effects.

2. Define purely functional programming.

    Purely functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes immutability, referential transparency, and the use of pure functions that do not have side effects. It involves creating and manipulating data structures using only functions, without changing the state of the program.

3. How do you think purely functional programming will differ from the programs youâ€™ve written so far in this course?

   Purely functional programming will differ from the programs I've written so far in this course in a few key ways. First, it will require me to think more carefully about the design of my data structures and how they are manipulated, since direct mutation of state is not allowed. Additionally, I will need to become more comfortable with higher-order functions and other functional programming constructs like closures and currying, which are used extensively in purely functional programming

## Things I want to know more about

1. What is an example of a purely functional language?
2. Why are we being introduced to this concept on the last reading of the Java intro section?
