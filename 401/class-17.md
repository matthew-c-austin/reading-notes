# Read: Class 17

## Reflections

This reading assignment talks about OAuth in the Spring ecosystem. It's the preferred way to incorporate logins with these apps we're making, because handling a whole userbase is large in scope.

## Readings

[Spring Boot and OAuth2](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-boot-oauth2/)

1. In non-technical terms, describe what using OAuth can provide for your application.

    Using OAuth in your application can provide a way for users to securely log in to your app using their existing accounts on other services, without having to create a new account specifically for your app.

2. Which authentication providers are covered in the tutorial?

    GitHub or Google

## Things I want to know more about

1. The guide used JQuery for the frontend, which seems not very helpful for what we'll be doing in this class.
