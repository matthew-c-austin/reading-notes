# Read: Class 04

## Reflections

This reading assignment introduces ojbect-oriented programming concepts in Java, which is important because Java is almost pure OO. Classes are also introduced, which is just an aspect of OO. We are also finally talking about binary and hex, which is at the root of everything going on with programming.

## Readings

[Java OO Tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/)

1. Explain the difference between an object and a class.

    An object is a bundle of related state and behavior in software (fields and methods, nouns and verbs).

2. Name two types of state that a Student object might have.

   `name`, `major`

3. Name two types of behaviours that a student object might have.

    `enroll(course)`, `graduate()`

[Java Classes](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/classes.html)

1. Explain the significance of a constructor for a class.

    A constructor is a block of code that handles how fields are set when an instance of a class is instantiated.

2. Write the declaration statement for a class named “Student” (do not fill it with fields and methods).

```Java
public class Student {
    // Fields, constructor, and methods will go here.
}
```

[Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers](https://www.mathsisfun.com/binary-decimal-hexadecimal.html)

1. What is the value of the binary number 1101?

    13

2. Write the number 52 in binary. Write it in hexidecimal.

    110100,0X34

## Things I want to know more about

1. Is it common to provide every permutation of constructor with parameters that are present? Or just a default and one with every parameter accounted for?
2. Are there lambda functions in Java, or passing functions as arguments?
