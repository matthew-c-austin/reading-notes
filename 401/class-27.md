## Reflections

This reading assignment talks about SharedPreferences, testing in Android with Espresso, and the Back Stack. All these concepts are important for Android development, and it's just more basic information to help learn how to develop Android apps.

## Readings

[Android SharedPreferences](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared-preferences)

[Espresso Testing](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso)

[ARidiculous superpower: the Espresso Test Recorder](https://developer.android.com/studio/test/other-testing-tools/espresso-test-recorder)

[Android Tasks and the Back Stack](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/tasks-and-back-stack)

1. What is a technology youâ€™ve used before that is similar to Shared Preferences?

    One technology that is similar to Shared Preferences is the concept of browser cookies in web development. Both Shared Preferences and cookies are used to store and retrieve small pieces of data in key-value pairs. They provide a way to persist data locally on the device or in the browser, respectively, to remember user preferences, settings, or other relevant information.

2. Why is testing important? Give at least 4 reasons, and explain which is the most important to you and why.

    - **Bug identification and prevention**: Testing helps identify and fix bugs and issues in software, preventing them from reaching end users and causing problems.
    - **Software reliability**
    - **User satisfaction**
    - **Maintainability and scalability**

3. Create an analogy for Tasks and the back stack. Have we used a similar system before? Explain.

    Tasks are similiar to the call stack. Imagine a stack of plates or some other stackable thing that needs cleaning. You add a plate to the top of the stack when it's done being used, and clean what is on the top first, popping it off the stack. The next dirty plate lies below for you to clean once you're done with your current plate.

## Things I want to know more about

1. I'm very curious how Espresso's automatic test generation works, but I'm sure it's a blackbox that's tough to get a grasp on.
