1. What is an Intent in Android Studios? Give some fresh examples of when you might use it.

    An Intent in Android Studio is a mechanism used for communication between different components of an Android application. It represents an operation to be performed, such as starting an activity or initiating a service. An explicit Intent is used to specifically start a particular component within the application, while an implicit Intent is used to perform actions based on the provided action and data, allowing interaction with other applications or system features.

2. Describe an Activity in your own word.

    An Activity in Android is a single screen with a user interface where users can interact with an application. It serves as a building block of an Android app, representing a distinct page that presents information or functionality to the user. Activities manage their own lifecycle and can contain UI elements to create an interactive interface. They interact with other components, such as starting new activities with Intents, receiving results, or communicating with services and content providers.
