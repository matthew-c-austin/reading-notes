# Reflections

This reading is our first official introduction to DSA. This is the gatekeeper for getting a job at any tech company, as the leetcode style interviews used by everyone is a prerequisite to any offer. More than that, though, it's important to deeply understand Big O and have a toolbox filled with data structures and algorithms to use in your career as a dev.

## Discussion Questions

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?

  Time complexity of the solution for operations like instertion/deletion/search/access/etc. Depending on the problem, you may prioritize one operation over another.
2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?

  Define a well-defined base case, so that when the function encounters the base case, it should return a value directly without making more recursive calls.
