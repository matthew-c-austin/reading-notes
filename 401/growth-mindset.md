# Reflections

This reading assignment lays the foundation for the mindset that is required for success in this course. Though it's been included in previous classes, I'm taking special note of the deliberate headspace described in each. A daytime course in a brand new language at the 401 level is going to take a lot out of me, and I need to be prepared for it.

### Readings Summary

Deliberate practice is a focused approach to learning and mastering a specific skill by breaking it down into smaller, manageable components, and working on them with purposeful effort, repetition, and feedback. It is an effective way to improve one's technical skills and achieve expertise in any domain. It's also about reaching outside your comfort zone to drill down into arenas that you are not comfortable in.

### Videos Summary

In these videos, the speakers emphasize the importance of fostering a growth mindset and cultivating grit in students to improve their academic performance and overall success. A "Not Yet" grading approach and understanding that abilities can be developed over time contribute to nurturing a growth mindset. Grit, characterized by passion and perseverance for long-term goals, is a significant predictor of success. By combining the concepts of grit and growth mindset, educators can create resilient and persistent students who are more likely to achieve in their academic and personal lives.

As it relates to myself and my career switch, I can employ grit and redefining of success and failure to build resiliency in the face of adversity, both in this class and in my job search.

## Measuring Emotional Intelligence

My total scores were:

Self-Awareness: 20
Self-Management: 17
Self-Awareness: 20
Relationship Management: 18

The need to improve self-management tracks with my own self-perception. It's a constant area of work for me. In the past I've had a tendency to wear my emotions on my sleeve, and this can cast a pall over my immediate vicinity if I'm in a sour mood at work (or anywhere really). Nothing is said out of turn generally, but I've struggled to hide how I'm really feeling. That said, therapy has helped with this and with all of the areas that I've scored higher than 18.

Relationship management, for instance, is really only passing because I've put in so much work on actively apologizing and showing contrition for mistakes I've made. That wasn't always the case.

## Assessing Bias

Overall, I scored a 96/120. My biggest gap is probably not engaging with those that challenge my opinions. I suppose I should interpret that as dissenting opinions from friends or colleagues, rather than how I took it, which is spending time around people who hold toxic views or are argumentative about my morals.

I also don't really challenge myself with new points of view or opinions, and perhaps I should, but my mind always goes to the fundamental things that I don't think would benefit from hearing the hot take of some ultra-conservative view on my ethics. If it's not stuff like that, then there's room for it, and maybe I should seek that out.
