# Graphs

## Basic Terminology

- **Vertex/Node**: A data object in a graph.
- **Edge**: A connection between two nodes.
- **Neighbor**: Nodes adjacent to a node.
- **Degree**: The number of edges connected to a node.

## Types of Graphs

- **Directed Graphs (Digraph)**: Graphs where edges have direction.
- **Undirected Graphs**: Graphs where edges do not have direction.
- **Complete Graphs**: Graphs where all nodes are connected to all other nodes.
- **Connected Graphs**: Graphs where all nodes have at least one edge.
- **Disconnected Graphs**: Graphs where some nodes do not have edges.
- **Acyclic Graphs**: Directed graphs with no cycles.
- **Cyclic Graphs**: Graphs that have cycles.

## Graph Representation

- **Adjacency Matrix**: 2D array representing connections between nodes.
- **Adjacency List**: A collection of lists that represent nodes connected to each node.
- **Weighted Graphs**: Graphs where edges have a weight/value.

## Graph Traversals

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Traversal where all the nodes closest to the root are visited first, followed by the next level.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Traversal where all nodes along a path are visited before visiting the next path.
