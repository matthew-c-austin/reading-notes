[6 Reasons for Pair Programming](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

    1. Greater efficiency
    2. Engaged collaboration
    3. Learning from fellow students
    4. Social skills
    5. Job interview readiness
    6. Work environment readiness

2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

    Hopefully (time will tell), work environment readiness.

3. How does pair programming work?

    While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs.

## Things I want to know more about

1. There's discussion of callback hell and how to properly write JS code to avoid it. I haven't dug into it, but I'd like to learn that and any other pitfalls of poor JS code writing (composition over inheritance and that kind of thing).
