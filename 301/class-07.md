[How I Explained REST to my Brother](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)

1. Who is Roy Fielding?

    A computer scientist who was one of the principal authors of the HTTP spec and the originator of the REST architectural style.

2. Why don’t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

    Machines don't have a universal noun - that's why they suck. Every programming language, database, or other kind of system has a different way of talking about nouns. That's why the URL is so important. It let's all of these systems tell each other about each other's nouns.

3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

    HTTP—this protocol Fielding and his friends created—is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

4. What does a GET do?

    Retrieve information from another system

5. What does a POST do?

    Add something to another system

6. What does PUT do?

    Replace something in another system

7. What does PATCH do?

    Partially update something in another system

## Things I want to know more about

1. Are RESTFUL APIs the majority of used interfaces nowadays? Or is SOAP still hanging around on big legacy enterprise systems?
